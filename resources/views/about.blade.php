                        interests on
                        cybersecurity and deployment of projects in the internet. He is naturally curious on how stuff works
                        and
                        thats why he spend a lot of time studying different stuff, from the newest technology to the

                        you need to win the boss fight. With curiousity, passion and power of anime in his side, he will
                        surely
                        attain everything that sets his mind on. Let's just hope he doesn't get distracted along the way
                        since
                        keeping focus is still his weakness in everyday life. In the future, he hope that his hardwork today

                        bear fruit one day that he can be proud of.
