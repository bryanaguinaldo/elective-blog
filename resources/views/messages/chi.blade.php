                    Hello Sir RJ, I want to thank you for a fruitful stay here in BulSU. Your classes are fun and very educational, I am grateful for your effort in trying to make every class interesting as much as possible. Although we prefer not to go to class whenever possible we still looked forward to go to your classes whenever there is one. One of the most important things I learned was Chunking, because I have been using this as a way to become more efficient in performing my tasks ðŸ¥´. Once again, we thank you for giving us one of the best experiences here in BulSU!
                    </p>
                    <p>- John Matthew Chi</p>
